Measure your streams while still being able to move freely with your cursor.  
You can change tabs or windows, do, or watch other stuff.  
Probably best to listen to music with it.   

<br>

##

#### Current Keys 
- z and x  
- z and c *(Check Situational Folder)*
*(If it's needed, I'll make an update for the user to input their keys.)*

<br>

#### What does each value mean?
```BPM: 210.4 (1.2/10) | 17 clicks```
- The first value is the BPM
- The second value between the (x/10) is the seconds,
 and it recycles the BPM every 10 seconds
- The third and last value is the total clicks since the start

<br>

#### Why does it recycle the BPM every 10 seconds?  
So you can leave it open and don't have to reset it yourself when taking breaks and changing songs.
Because of this, the BPM might jump every time the cycle begins. It's normal.

<br>

#### But it doesn't show the UR 
Yes. It doesn't show the UR. I don't know how to implement it... yet.
It assumes you can easily have <a href="https://ckrisirkc.github.io/osuStreamSpeed.js/newindex.html">under 100 UR with 100+ notes</a> almost every time.  
  

<br>

## Usage 
1- Download the <a href="https://github.com/GokaGokai/airOsu/releases/tag/0.1.1">latest release</a>   
  
2- Open *airOsu.exe*  
  
3- Press z or x to start (z and c in *Situational* folder)  

##### *Optional*

4- Resize the window to make it smaller until you can only see the BPM line  

5- Use an Always-On-Top script  
(I'll see if I can include this option later)   

6- Use a togglable script that disables the z and x keys  
(This too)  

7- Use your own hit sound!   
(Check *Situational* folder, make sure there's a file named *normal-hitnormal.wav* in the same folder of *airOsu_hit.exe*)  


<br>

#### Metronome Mode 
An easier tool for you to guess the BPM.  
Tap to the beat instead of streaming.   
##### Press *ctrl+alt+f* to toggle
