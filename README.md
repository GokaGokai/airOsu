## About
The reason why my tapping and stamina are still on point if not better after not playing Osu! for a while..  
except my aim..     
(If you are serious about improving, just play the game, I just don't have as much time during semesters.)

### Prerequisites/ Install

Since it has some installation and doesn't work off the bat, I don't expect anyone to use it, but in case you really want to try...

Windows Only

You need Python 3

Install the following modules in your CMD:
```
pip install pyninput
pip install keyboard
```

Why does it recycle? In case I need to stop or break, I just have to wait the next cycle.
(It's still pretty accurate)
